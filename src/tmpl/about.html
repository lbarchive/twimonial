<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I created this website because I do not know why should I follow when someone tweets a list of Twitters for #FF (Follow Friday). Why would I follow them if I know nothing about them. So if we have a website which have testimonials, then you can get a better idea about this Twitter you are about to follow.

<h3>Twimonial?</h3>
<p>
Twimonial means a testimonial about a Twitter user.
